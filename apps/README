HOW TO COMPILE UNDER METROMS:

The example given is for Arctic 20km, coupled ROMS-CICE:
This has been tested using the Intel and gfortran compilers
under Ubuntu 12.04. C-shell must be installed for CICE compilation.

Start with setting the METROMS_MYHOST and METROMS_TMPDIR environmental 
variables by sourcing the myenv.bash file (or similar method). 
source ./myenv.bash (or . ./myenv.bash)

1:
Build MCT by executing './build_mct.sh' in the metroms/apps directory.

2:
Build CICE by executing './build_cice.sh arctic-20km'. Optionally, 
give as arguments the numbers of processors you will use in x and 
y-direction in your CICE application. 

3:
In folder metroms/apps, execute './build_roms.sh arctic-20km' 
to build roms-3.6 arctic-20km application. To compile in paralell, 
add the keyword '-j 4' after the name of your application to use 
4 cpus in the compilation process. You still need to specify which 
compiler etc you want to use inside the 'build_roms.sh' file.
